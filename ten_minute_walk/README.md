# Ten Minute Walk

My approach:
- I made these notes on the problem
```
- true if 10 mins and ends at start
- 1 minute = 1 block, 10 blocks in 10 minutes
- dont need to worry about bad elements in array
- if n = s && e = w (count)
```
- I then went about making the tests and passing the simplest before moving on
- Finally I solved the logic within the rb file.

## The Task:

Take a ten minute walk

Create a function that will return true if the walk will take you exactly ten minutes and will return you to your starting point.
Requirements

You are meeting a friend in New York City, where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to the appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk.
The city provides its tourists with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk. eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']

You always walk only a single block in a direction and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).
Acceptance Criteria
```
ten_minute_walk?(['w', 's', 'e', 'e', 'n', 'n', 'e', 's', 'w', 'w']) # => true
ten_minute_walk?(['w', 's', 'e', 'n', 'n', 'e', 's', 'w', 'w', 'w']) # => false
ten_minute_walk?(['w', 's', 'e', 's', 's', 'e', 's', 'w', 'n', 'n']) # => false
ten_minute_walk?(['w', 's']) # => false
```
