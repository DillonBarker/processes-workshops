# middle letter challenge

- This task was to make a method that returns the middle character or characters of a string.

- If odd there is just one, if even there is two.

### What I did

- In the workshop I started incorporating an array and ran out of time as it wasn't working.

- So after I went back and solved it after having some time to think and it was much simpler than what I was trying.

- Both my before and after code can be seen in the lib folder.
